 *  - Trae's own `multimodal` flag, which is what makes "auto" work at all.
 *
 * Rationale: Trae's IDE enables its attach-image button purely from this flag
 * (`metadata.capabilities.vision`), with no user switch, so a model Trae itself
 * calls multimodal is one the vendor expects to receive images. Requiring a
 * manual tick for those made this plugin the only place where a vendor-declared
 * capability had to be re-enabled by hand.
 *
 * Why the flag alone is not enough, and the union is:
 *
 *  - the flag is advisory, not a contract. `llm_utils_chat` is a lightweight
 *    SOLO channel and this plugin has been burned by `4001 param is invalid`
 *    for ids that LOOKED valid, so the flag is not treated as proof of
 *    callability — a model still has to have survived the wire join to appear
 *    at all. The flag only decides image input, never model availability.
 *  - Users who already ticked a model keep that tick even after a refresh stops
 *    reporting the flag, so the union never silently revokes a working setup.
 *  - `input` remains the ONLY thing told to DSH: a model that ends up without
 *    `image` here is one DSH will degrade images to text for, which is the
 *    safe direction for a model whose capability we cannot confirm.
 *
 * `multimodal === true` is a strict test: absent, `false`, or any non-boolean
 * leaves the model text-only unless the user opted in.

 * supplies the real `llm_utils_chat` `config_name` — the only id the chat
 * endpoint actually accepts — plus the authoritative post-discount credit
 * multiplier when `display_contact_config` carries one.
 *
 * A remote row with no wire match is STILL KEPT (decision 2026-10-02, issue
 * #19). It previously was dropped, on the reasoning that a row with no
 * `config_name` is sent as an invalid one and rejected with 4001. That
 * reasoning holds only for the accounts and functions we can measure, and
 * measuring is the problem: whether a roster contains a model is ACCOUNT-
 * SCOPED, so "no wire entry on a free account" cannot prove a paying account
 * cannot call it. Dropping on that evidence silently denied those users models
 * their own Trae IDE offers. The row therefore ships, and its call fails
 * honestly: the bridge now translates the in-stream refusal into a readable
 * error (`4001` → "Trae does not serve this model under the SOLO function the
 * request used", `4011` → "Trae refused this model under the SOLO function the
 * request used"), so a user who picks an unusable model is told why instead of
 * seeing nothing. This reverses the 2026-08-30 note about `Doubao-Seed-Code`,
 * which later turned out to be callable under `chat_v3`.
 *
 * Credit multiplier precedence: the wire's `display_contact_config` rate wins
 * whenever present (it is the post-discount figure the Trae IDE renders — the
 * Remote directory can report up to 10x the undiscounted value, see
 * `wireCreditMultiplier` in solo.ts); the Remote `consumption_rate` is the
 * fallback when the wire row carries none.
 *
 * Joining is two-tier, in priority order:
 *  1. `wire.id` (the `config_name`) equals the remote id — the model's display
 *     id is already its wire id (the common case: glm-5.2,
 *     DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Official, kimi-k3, …).
 *  2. `wire.name` (the `display_name`) equals the remote display name — for
 *     models whose display id differs from the wire id across Trae versions.
 * When the matched wire `config_name` differs from the remote id it is recorded
 * as `wireConfigName`; otherwise it is left undefined (id is already the wire id).
